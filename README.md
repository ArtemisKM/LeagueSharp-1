Fed LB doesn't use DFG... It works with activator though. Im looking at the code it seems that you have to call the item a different way. Should be a easy fix. I think ill have it done 1-2 days.

Fed Mao - Doesnt use Q in combo mode but uses it in gank mode. Which is fucked due to the fact that the code is literally the same thing for both.

Fed Cait - Always uses auto e on gap closers.... not a horrible thing. But I can see how its annoying. Ill see if i can fix it.

Fed Jax - Ward jumping is just fucked. I have the code the thing from scratch maybe. I will be the last thing I work on. I might just rip it from a kat script.

Added two repo's that aren't from fed champs. But I updated them because  no one seems to want to.

Aatrox and Akali were added. Akali's works flawlessly. Dunno about Aatrox. Hopefully someone leaves feedback.
